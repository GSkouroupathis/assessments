Hello and Welcome to PeerIndex Assestment Day. 

Please find an eclipse project with some code-stubs which you need to fill out. 

The task is to crawl and store as many URLs as possible from our list of URLs. 

Before starting your assessment, please create a new repo git branch called YOURFIRSTNAME+INITIAL,
if your name is Joe Bloggs, the branch should be called joeb. 

You can find the code in the "src" folder

and you can find the URL data in "resources"

Good luck

-----------------------------------------------------
Extra task, implement TF-IDF[1] on a sample of URLs from your KeyValue Store.
